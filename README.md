# api-gerenciador-viagens-qa
Tests developed during my time as an QA Trainee in the API https://github.com/AntonioMontanha/gerenciador-viagens using Rest Assured.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Java 8
Maven
InteliJ (For easy of use)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
1 - Download the project with git clone.
```

```
2 - Run the api locally by running the maven commands:

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

```
3 - Then the api will be up, by default, at:  

http://localhost:8089/
```

```
4 - You can check the Swagger doc at: 

http://localhost:8089/api/swagger-ui.html#/
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
